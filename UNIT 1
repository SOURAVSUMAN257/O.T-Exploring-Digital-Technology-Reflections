BASIC INTRODUCTION
The first week was mainly focused on introduction to Computerâ€™s Hardware and Data processing structure.The course started with the introduction of Digital technology. The Hallmark for the Digitally based technologies is that they work on very low power consumption. For instance our Laptop and similar machines hardly require a few 5-9 volts for its functioning. Digital technology uses Binary codes for its processing and storage.
On the other extreme , we have Analog Technology which functions on some physical parameters like Sound waves, signals etc. These Analog technologies are efficient medium for communication and signal processings.
