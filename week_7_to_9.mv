Week 7 to 9 
Last weeks we discussed about Command prompt and basic Files handling through fundamental commands like  ls ( list dictionary), cd ( change dictionary), rm( remove file),mv( moving File ), cp( copy file), rmdir( removing Dictionary) and  cdâ€¦ etc etc..
In week 5 we had a short quiz based on the Fundamentals of the Command Prompts. We continued our session by getting Handsonn with UBUNTU ( A Wsl software) for learning the Basics of Linux. 
Similar to what we did with command prompt, we did basic file handling and website access using Linux. We were also encouraged to Work Further on Linux and pull Push the Files on GitHub. In fact in one of the Class demonstrations we were actually taught to Pull a file from the repository in Github, make some changes and Pushed back to make an update.
In one of the sessions , we had a guest Lecture by Jeromem. The Lecture was centered around Building Blocks of Automation. He introduced us to the Fundamentals of Automation Like Sensors, system,Controller etc and their functioning in Automation of cycles.
For demonstration purposes he gave us many Day to Day examples. Overall the Session was so interactive and engaging.
